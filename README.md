		QUESTION:  
     	Given an input stream of characters, return the first-seen character which occurred only once in the input. For example, if the input stream was:
     	
     	ICELANDIC - Your function should return E.
     	BARBARIAN - Your function should return I.

     	You may assume a stream has two functions:
     	getNextCharacter() – returns the next character in the sequence, or null if there are no remaining characters.
     	isEnd() – returns true if there are no remaining characters in the string.
